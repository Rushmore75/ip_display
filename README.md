# Seven Segment Display (x4)
This program allows you to display long text on a 4 digit 7 segment display.


I changed the "o" char (and "O") to be lowercase o instead of uppercase, so that it doesn't share the 0 char on the display. This is just personal preference and I changed it in the library it's self.
